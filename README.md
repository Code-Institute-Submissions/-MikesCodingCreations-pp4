** Restaurant App - La Grill: Fine dinning **

HTML, CSS, Python, Django.

//Please read.

I decided to create this resturant app that allows users to:
1. read about the website
2. browse photos of the resturant/food items
3. view the menu
4. make reservations
5. contact the resurant owner.
6. allow the owner to view reservations, and make changes, additions to the menu.


Unfortunetly due to personal circumstances, i was not able to compelte this probject. I am aware A LOT is missing however i am confident i can complete it to a high standard.

I would appriciate if you could offer an extension on me re-submitting the project at a later date.
