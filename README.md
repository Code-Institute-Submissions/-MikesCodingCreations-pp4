** Restaurant App - La Grill: Fine dinning **

HTML, CSS, Python, Django.

I decided to create this resturant app that allows users to:
1. read about the website
2. browse photos of the resturant/food items
3. view the menu
4. make reservations
5. contact the resurant owner.
6. allow the owner to view reservations, and make changes, additions to the menu.
