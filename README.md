-   ### Design
    -   #### Wireframe mockup
        -   A wireframe has been created for two different perspectives. One for a customer user and one for a site owner user.
        -   Both wireframes share similarities in the steps a user can take and where those click will lead to. 
        -   In the admin/site owner mockup, the wireframe is longer as it allows users to create or edit menu items as well as delete reservations.
        -   The wireframes display the flow of a user from the start of entering the page to any click they make such as navigating or submitting data.
        -   The wireframe mockups were made using Figma and can be accessed via this [link:](https://www.figma.com/file/XKsMr6U3Ne7jjkrnuNeiNt/PP4-Workflow?type=whiteboard&node-id=0%3A1&t=KJOwujAo3JGR7sj5-1)
    -   #### Colour Scheme
        -   The three main colors used are black, white, and gold.
            - The reasoning behind the color choices is from backed studies from [[AlabamaChain](https://alabamachanin.com/journal/2015/01/inspiration-black-and-gold)], [[LoveHappens Magazine] (https://www.lovehappensmag.com/blog/2023/01/10/black-and-gold-an-iconic-color-combo/)] and [[My Smart Blog], (https://mystart.com/blog/shining-in-contrast-unveiling-the-symbolism-behind-black-gold/)] that indicate colors such as black and gold are associated with importance, luxury, or prestige. Something the company strives for. Moreover, the white is then used for text to stand out on the page.
    -   #### Typography
            -   The Rozha One font is the main font used throughout the whole website with  Serif as the fallback font in case for any reason the font isn't being imported into the site correctly. Rozha One is a clean font used frequently in restaurant websites, so it is both attractive and appropriate.
    -   #### Imagery
            -   Imagery is important, and so is the lack of imagery. The large, background hero page which is just black signifies the simplicity and fine dining   establishment that it is. You will see from trends that the lower class an organization/restaurant is, the more colors and images they have going on. Therefore keeping the background image a plain black page with strong colors such as white and gold will provide the user with all the information they need.
