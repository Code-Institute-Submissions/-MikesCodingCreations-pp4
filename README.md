## User Experience (UX)
### Design
#### Wireframe mockup
    - A wireframe has been created for two different perspectives. One for a customer user and one for a site owner user.
    - Both wireframes share similarities in the steps a user can take and where those click will lead to. 
    - In the admin/site owner mockup, the wireframe is longer as it allows users to create or edit menu items as well as delete reservations.
    - The wireframes display the flow of a user from the start of entering the page to any click they make such as navigating or submitting data.
    - The wireframe mockups were made using Figma and can be accessed via this [link:](https://www.figma.com/file/XKsMr6U3Ne7jjkrnuNeiNt/PP4-Workflow?type=whiteboard&node-id=0%3A1&t=KJOwujAo3JGR7sj5-1)
    - The idea behind the 'La Grill' website is to showcase a prestige grilling restuarant. The restuarant should display information about the company, offer custoemrs an insight into the menu, allow them to  keep up to date via blogs, offer opportunity to engage with the owners either via blog comments or via contact such as phone or email and offer the abaility to make a reservation.
    - Owners of the company can view, modify or delete any content such as Menu's at their choosing to update their customer base.

#### Colour Scheme
    - The three main colors used are black, white, and gold.
    - The reasoning behind the color choices is from backed studies from [[AlabamaChain](https://alabamachanin.com/journal/2015/01/inspiration-black-and-gold)], [[LoveHappens Magazine] (https://www.lovehappensmag.com/blog/2023/01/10/black-and-gold-an-iconic-color-combo/)] and [[My Smart Blog], (https://mystart.com/blog/shining-in-contrast-unveiling-the-symbolism-behind-black-gold/)] that indicate colors such as black and gold are associated with importance, luxury, or prestige. Something the company strives for. Moreover, the white is then used for text to stand out on the page.

#### Typography
    - The Rozha One font is the main font used throughout the whole website with  Serif as the fallback font in case for any reason the font isn't being imported into the site correctly. Rozha One is a clean font used frequently in restaurant websites, so it is both attractive and appropriate.

#### Imagery
    - Imagery is important, and so is the lack of imagery. The large, background hero page which is just black signifies the simplicity and fine dining   establishment that it is. You will see from trends that the lower class an organization/restaurant is, the more colors and images they have going on. Therefore keeping the background image a plain black page with strong colors such as white and gold will provide the user with all the information they need.

    - Automated testing:
        - *Blog test*:
            - Testing forms:
                - For the blog forms, I ran three tests. 
                    1. One for testing the CommentForm has the expected Field.
                    2. One for testing the CommentForm with the content.
                    3. And another for testing the CommentForm without content.
                        - When running the test with *Python3 manage.py test* command, I saw that the first test [failed](https://github.com/MikesCodingCreations/pp4/blob/main/media/testing-media/testing_blog/form_test/failed_blog_forms_test.png), whereas all the rest passed.
                        - This is because of a mismatch between the expected and actual field names in the CommentForm.
                        - The test expects the form.fields.keys() to return a list containing only the key "content".
                        - However, the actual output shows dict_keys(['content']).
                    - Solution:
                        - To fix this, I simply convert the dict_keys object to a list using the list() function. 
                            [Here's the updated test](https://github.com/MikesCodingCreations/pp4/blob/main/media/testing-media/testing_blog/form_test/updated_blog_forms_test.png)
                    - The blog form test now passes all three [tests](https://github.com/MikesCodingCreations/pp4/blob/main/media/testing-media/testing_blog/form_test/passed_blog_forms_test.png)
            - Testing views:
                - For the blog views, I ran three tests. 
                    1. One for testing the post list view - PostListViewTest 
                        - When running the test with *Python3 manage.py test* command, I saw that the following [passed](https://github.com/MikesCodingCreations/pp4/blob/main/media/testing-media/testing_blog/views_test/postlistview_test_success.png)

                    2. One for testing the post detail view - PostDetailViewTest
                        - When running the test with *Python3 manage.py test* command, I saw that the following [passed](https://github.com/MikesCodingCreations/pp4/blob/main/media/testing-media/testing_blog/views_test/postdetailview_test_success.png)

                    3. And another for the post by category view - PostByCategoryViewTest
                        - When running the test with *Python3 manage.py test* command, I saw that the following [error](https://github.com/MikesCodingCreations/pp4/blob/main/media/testing-media/testing_blog/views_test/postbycategoryview_test_fail.png)
                        - To fix this, I added a URL pattern for the 'post_by_category' view as [such](https://github.com/MikesCodingCreations/pp4/blob/main/media/testing-media/testing_blog/views_test/new_blog_urls_test.png)
                        - The test now [passes](https://github.com/MikesCodingCreations/pp4/blob/main/media/testing-media/testing_blog/views_test/postbycategoryview_test_pass.png)
        - *Menu test*:
            - Testing forms:

                            - When running the test with *Python3 manage.py test* command, I saw that the test [passed](https://github.com/MikesCodingCreations/pp4/blob/main/media/testing-media/testing_menu/testingforms/testingmenuforms_passed.png)
            - Testing views: 
                - For the MenuViewsTests, I ran four tests.

                        2. One for testing that add menu view returns a permission error for non-superusers with valid data.
                        3. One for testing that add menu view handles invalid data for superusers.
                        4. One for testing that edit menu view handles invalid data for superusers.
                            - When running the test with *Python3 manage.py test* command, I saw that the following [passed](https://github.com/MikesCodingCreations/pp4/blob/main/media/testing-media/testing_menu/testingviews/testingmenuforms_passed.png)
        - *Reservation test*:
            - Testing forms:
                For the reservation forms, I created a test case - ReserveTableFormTests and within it, I ran 5 tests.
                    1. One for testing that the form includes all fields from the model except 'created'.
                    2. One for testing the 'name' field is required.
                    3. One for testing the 'phone_number' field is required.
                    4. One for testing the 'email' field is required.
                    4. One for testing the 'email' field is valid.
                    5. One for testing a valid email address is accepted.
                        - When running the test with *Python3 manage.py test* command, I saw that the tests [passed](https://github.com/MikesCodingCreations/pp4/blob/main/media/testing-media/testing_reservations/testingforms/forms_ReserveTableFormTest_test_passed.png)
            - Testing views:
                For the reservation views, I created a test case - ReservationViewTests and within it ran, 8 tests.
                    1. One for testing the reserve table get request.

                        - When running the test with *Python3 manage.py test* command, I saw that all tests [passed](https://github.com/MikesCodingCreations/pp4/blob/main/media/testing-media/testing_reservations/testingviews/ReservationViewTests_test_passed.png)
        
### Further Testing
-   The Website was tested on Google Chrome, Microsoft Edge and Safari browsers.
-   The website was viewed on a variety of devices such as Desktop, Laptop, and iPhone X.
-   A large amount of testing was done to ensure that all pages were connecting correctly.
-   Friends and family members were asked to review the site and documentation to point out any bugs and/or user experience issues.

### Future Imporvements
-   Having the ability to display users their own reservations is a feature that could be implemented in the future.
-   Displaying the confirmed date and time to users in the thank you page when making a successful reservation.
-   Implementing paginaton within the blogs page to reduce how many blogs show up on each page.
